# NoVNC Server
Sometimes, you want to use a graphical application, but don't want to fight with Replit's built-in VNC server. Why use Replit's server when you can create your own?
This works not only for applications, but also for running entire desktop environments, such as <a href="https://replit.com/@9pfs/lxqt">lxqt</a> or <a href="https://replit.com/@9pfs/lumina">Lumina</a>. Even <a href="https://replit.com/@9pfs/slax2vnc">Slax</a><sup>(<a href="https://slax.org">Download</a>)</sup>, a (Linux distribution based on Debian)'s desktop works!
